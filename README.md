# Temperature-Control-Device

The device serves to maintain a constant liquid temperature. The temperature sensor must be placed in the liquid and the relay is used to control whether the heater is turned on or off. The liquid will be exactly in a set range of temperature with small variations depending on the amount of liquid. It's possible to change the temperature by clicking the button on the rotary encoder and rotating it to the wanted temperature. The screen shows the current temperature and set temperature.

The device was originally intended for the production of beer, where at a certain stage it is important that the temperature be 69 degrees Celsius.
